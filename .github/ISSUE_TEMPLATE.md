# Issue
>Put the subject of the issue here. This can be a sentence, a paragraph, or a whole page. Whatever best describes the problem.

**Example**:
The project currently does not have an ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file
# Features
>List the benefits of resolving your issue here. This section is optional and likely not needed for bug reports.

**Example**:
An ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file guides new contributors to discuss their problems and ideas in a format existing contributors are already familiar with.

Additionally, such a file helps improve our organizational quality by keeping a consistent  standard for every issue. We spend more time thinking about the content provided and less time trying to make sense of how a contributor formatted their issue.
# Resolution
>If you have a proposed resolution ready, discuss it here. try to organize it in separate labels if there is a lot of content. This format is also helpful if you want to use the [Task List](#task-list) section also.

**Example**:
## Create an example template
Draft an ISSUE_TEMPLATE file and outline the use of each section with an example.
## Have fun!
Now that this file exists, use it and have fun in the experience of open source contribution!
# Task List
>If your issue has multiple steps, create a task list so we can mark off each achievement. The text for each task is recommend to be one of your headers under [Resolution](#resolution)

**Example**:
- [ ] - Create an example template
- [ ] - Have fun!
