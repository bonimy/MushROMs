# What is MushROMs?
MushROMs started as a basic level editor for Super Mario All-Stars for the SNES. In time, it fell back to being a generic editor for any tile-based layout game (NES, SNES, Genesis, etc.). However, most of the work currently emphasizes SNES games. What it can ultimately do will come down to what the contributors want it to do.
# Installation
Presently, the Visual Studio IDE is the only supported environment for MushROMs. Users are encouraged to suggest new environments as an [Issue](https://github.com/bonimy/MushROMs/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/bonimy/MushROMs/pulls).
## Visual Studio
MushROMs is primarily being built in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) with [.NET 4.7](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/05/announcing-the-net-framework-4-7/). Both are free of charge. There are currently no other known dependencies, so setup should be as easy as hitting the Build & Run button.
